\title{Runs BRETIGEA using top 1, top 1 & 2, top 1,2,3 ... to top 1...n markers
A function that reruns the BRETIGEA findCells method (modified) on a loop to see
the influence of different combinations of markers in determining the cell-type
proportion estimate.}
\usage{
bretMarkerEffectOnPathology(
  countDf,
  bretCellMarkers,
  cellName,
  metadata,
  covar,
  pathologyName,
  cellTypeNames,
  n
)
}
\arguments{
\item{countDf}{A dataframe with Gene rows and Subject columns.}

\item{bretCellMarkers}{A dataframe with two columns, markers and cell where
markers are genes for cell types and cell indicates the cell type markers
are the gene for.}

\item{cellName}{A string indicating which of the cells in the cell type marker list
is being specified to look at.}

\item{metadata}{A dataframe with subjects also in countDf and rows
indicating the subjects id, some covariate, and disease state score or
pathology.}

\item{covar}{A covariate to be taken into account when running linear models
to check the association between the cell type indicated by cell and the
pathology indicated by pathologyNames.}

\item{pathologyName}{The pathology associated with the disease in question
for which the association between it and the cell type indicated by cell is
being examined.}

\item{cellTypeNames}{The names of all the unique cell types for which
there are markers in bretCellMarkers: unique(bretCellMarkers$cell)}

\item{n}{Specifies how many times BRETIGEA will run BRETIGEA using top 1,
top 1 & 2, top 1,2,3 ... to top 1...n markers}
}
\value{
Returns a graph of the significance of the cell type proportion
specified's association to the pathology indicated upon marker addition
from 0 to n
}
